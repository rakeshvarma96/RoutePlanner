Assumptions and Approach :
--------------------------
1. Have made use of static inventory which gets populated when app comes up.
	Inventory gets populated in the below manner:

	Date		Route 		InventoryInfo
	----		----- 		--------------

	I have stored the inventory as map of maps.

2. Have used rest api to get the routes based on fare or duration, but we can use kafka in place of that.

3. Have used factory pattern to sort the trips based on fare or duration.

4. Technologies used: Java, Springboot, maven.
